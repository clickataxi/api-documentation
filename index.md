The Click A Taxi API provides the ability to create and retrieve required information in order to book taxis globally.

## Introduction

Every URL is in the format https://api.clickataxi.com/:resource[/:action[?:params]] such as https://api.clickataxi.com/places/nearby to get a list of nearby places.

Every request must include a `User-Agent` header with your application name and an url or email address. We need this for tracking purposes and we might contact you in case this information isn't probably filled out. An example of a good header would be `FooBooking-Version5 (http://foo-bookings.com/)`. Requests without this header might get a `400 Bad Request` in future versions of the API.

The `Accept` header specifies which format to return. Only `application/json` is supported.

Returned format may be overridden by appending a format parameter to a request e.g. https://api.clickataxi.com/companies?format=json.

Clients must include an `Accept` header with a custom Click A Taxi mime type to specify which version of the API to use e.g.

	application/vnd.clickataxi[.version]+[type]

If this header isn't specified the latest API version is used but it's highly recommended to specific a specific version since future revisions might not be fully backward compatible.

Currently `v1`, `v2` and `latest` are supported as `version` and `json` as `type`. 

Responses will be compressed if request includes an `Accept-Encoding` header with a `gzip` value.

<!-- FUTURE: Operations using a `lang` or `language` parameter might use an `Accept-Language` header instead. -->

All timestamps are represented as ISO 8601 format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

IDs are represented as strings and should be stored and treated as strings. Format of IDs might change across API versions.

Example requests are constructed using [cURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) commands.


## Suggested booking flow

As as minimum requirement to book a taxi, one must first [authenticate](#authorizations) then create a [create a client](#clients) and finally [create a booking](#post_clients_bookings). Usually one would also like to display which taxi companies [operate in a given area](#spot_companies) and check if that company allows automated bookings and/or a special type of vehicle. To check if company supports automated bookings the "automatedBooking" attribute on a company should be checked. If this is `false` our API can't book on this company i.e. trying to place a booking through the API will fail but you may use returned phone number for company to display this as a fallback in your application flow. Most companies on our platform allows automatic booking, though.


## Authentication

You authenticate by sending token either as an `Authorization` header:

	curl https://api.clickataxi.com \
		-H "Authorization: Token token=\"OAUTH-TOKEN\""

Or by appending it as an `access_token` parameter:

	curl https://api.clickataxi.com?access_token=OAUTH-TOKEN

Tokens can be initially acquired programmatically using basic authentication through [/authorizations](#authorizations).


## JSON-P callbacks

You may send a `?callback` parameter to any GET operations to have results wrapped in a JSON callback function. This is typically used when browsers want to embed content in web pages by getting around cross domain issues. The response includes the same data output as the regular API, plus the relevant HTTP Header information.


## Operations

### <a id="authorizations"></a> POST /authorizations

Requests an authorization token by posting via basic authentication. Upon successful authentication a 256-bit token will be returned which should be used for future requests. These access tokens doesn't by default expire but it might become invalid over time. Using an invalid token in requests will result in `401 Unauthorized` responses and you should in that case re-issue a request for a new token.

#### Example request

	curl https://api.clickataxi.com/authorizations \
		-u john:doe -d '' \
		-H 'Accept: application/vnd.clickataxi.v2+json' \
		-H 'Content-type: application/json'

#### Example response

	HTTP/1.0 201 Created
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

	{
	    "token": "1111a3bb8d4a40f08100e640621fee10"
	}

### <a id="post_clients_bookings"></a> POST /clients/:clientId/bookings

Requests a new taxi booking for an existing [client](#clients). An immediate booking is requested by excluding `arrivalAt` attribute from body. A pre-booking should always have an `arrivalAt` in its body. Notice, some taxi companies require a destination address so a call to [/companies/spot](#spot_companies) should be made before booking in a new area. Check `destinationRequired` attribute on response to find out if a destination address is required in that area.

A success response means our system has accepted your request for a taxi but not necessarily that this taxi will be booked. Since we are connecting to real taxi companies around the globe it sometimes will not be possible to fulfill the order. You should check the order status by calling [/clients/:clientId/bookings/:bookingsId](#get_client_booking) regularly.


#### Request attributes

`pickup` Pickup details

`dropoff` Dropoff details

`vehicleType` Type of car which is requested. Valid values are returned in [companies/spot](#spot_companies) operations (`vehicleTypes` attribute)

`arrivalAt` Optional date and time for when taxi is requested. If not specified a taxi is immediately requested.

`comment` An optional comment for driver to see.



#### Example request

Creates a pre-booking of a medium sized taxi for Christmas Eve. A `pickup` structure may include a `placeRef` attribute instead of a full address in case you want to book at a [Point Of Interest](#nearby_places). Client is bringing a child so a child seat is requested as a service too.
